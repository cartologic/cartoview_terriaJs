            "text": "The easiest way to get started with TerriaJS is to use \nTerriaMap\n.  TerriaMap is a full-featured application built on TerriaJS, ready to be customized with your own branding and catalog.  It is also a great starting point for more in-depth customization.\n\n\nThis guide explains how to build and run TerriaMap locally.  See \nDeploying\n to learn how to deploy it for use by others.\n\n\nYou may also be interested in how to \nmake your own map without writing any code\n.\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\nIf you've done this sort of thing before, you'll find it easy to clone and build TerriaMap with these quick instructions:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap.git\n\ncd TerriaMap\n\nnpm install \n npm run gulp \n npm start\n\n# Open at http://localhost:3001\n\n\n\n\nIf you run into trouble or want more explanation, read on.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nTerriaJS can be built and run on almost any macOS, Linux, or Windows system.  The following are required to build TerriaJS:\n\n\n\n\nNode.js\n v6.0 or later.  v7.x is also known to work.  We currently recommend that you avoid using v8.x because v8.x includes npm v5.x which causes problems with some of our dependencies.  You can check your node version by running \nnode --version\n on the command-line.\n\n\nnpm\n v3.0 or later.  We currently recommend that you avoid using v5.x.  npm is usually installed automatically alongside the above.  You can check your npm version by running \nnpm --version\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe following components are optional:\n\n\n\n\nGDAL\n - Used for the conversion service that transforms Esri Shapefiles and other more obscure formats into GeoJSON for display in TerriaJS.  This is \nnot\n required for formats that TerriaJS supports directly, including KML, GeoJSON, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCloning TerriaMap\n\n\nThe latest version of TerriaMap is on \nGitHub\n, and the preferred way to get it is by using \ngit\n:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap.git\n\ncd TerriaMap\n\n\n\n\nIf you're unable to use git, you can also \ndownload a ZIP file\n and extract it somewhere on your system.  We recommend using git, though, because it makes it much easier to update to later versions in the future.\n\n\nInstalling Dependencies\n\n\nAll of the dependencies required to build and run TerriaMap, other than the prerequisites listed above, are installed using \nnpm\n:\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\nThe dependencies are installed in the \nnode_modules\n subdirectory.  No global changes are made to your system.\n\n\nBuilding TerriaMap\n\n\nDo a standard build of TerriaMap with:\n\n\nnpm run gulp\n\n\n\n\nOr, you can create a minified release build with:\n\n\nnpm run gulp release\n\n\n\n\nTo watch for changes and automatically do an incremental build when any are detected, use:\n\n\nnpm run gulp watch\n\n\n\n\nnpm run gulp\n simply runs \ngulp\n, so you can use that directly if you prefer (run \nnpm install -g gulp\n to install it globally).\n\n\nThe full set of \ngulp\n tasks can be found on the \nDevelopment Environment\n page.\n\n\nRunning TerriaMap\n\n\nTerriaMap includes a simple Node.js-based web server, called \nterriajs-server\n.  To start it, run:\n\n\nnpm start\n\n\n\n\nThen, open a web browser on \nhttp://localhost:3001\n to use TerriaMap.\n\n\nKeeping up with Updates\n\n\nIf you're building an application by using TerriaMap as a starting point, you will want to keep in sync as TerriaMap is improved and updated to use new versions of TerriaJS.  Forking the TerriaMap repo and using git to keep it in sync is outside the scope of this document, but GitHub has a \nnice explanation\n.\n\n\nAfter pulling new changes, you will need to run \nnpm install\n again to pick up any changed dependencies and then build TerriaMap.  If you have problems building or running, it is sometimes helpful to remove and reinstall the dependencies from npm:\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nNow that you have a working local build of TerriaMap, you may want to \ncustomize it\n or \ndeploy it\n for others to use.",

In a default TerriaMap installation, the main init file is found in \nwwwroot/init/terria.json\n.\n\n\nAn init file is a \nJSON file\n with this basic structure:\n\n\n{\n    \ncatalog\n: [\n        {\n            \ntype\n: \ngroup\n,\n            \nname\n: \nMy group\n,\n            \nitems\n: [\n            ...\n            ]\n        },\n        ...\n    ],\n    \nhomeCamera\n: {\n        \nnorth\n: -8,\n        \neast\n: 158,\n        \nsouth\n: -45,\n        \nwest\n: 109\n    },\n    \ninitialCamera\n: { ... },\n    \ncorsDomains\n: [ \nmyserver.gov.au\n ]\n}\n\n\n\n\nKey points:\n\n\n\n\ncatalog\n is an array.\n\n\nEvery element of that array must have a \ntype\n (corresponding to a value recognised by TerriaJS) and a \nname\n.\n\n\nThe three major categories of catalog member types are:\n\n\nCatalog Group\n: A group (folder) of items.  Different group types allow the contents to be manually specified or to be automatically determined by querying various types of server.\n\n\nCatalog Item\n: Actual geospatial or chart data from a file or service, in various formats.\n\n\nCatalog Function\n: A parameterized service, such as a Web Processing Service (WPS).  The user supplies the parameters and gets back some result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the other properties of each layer depend on the specific type.  See the links above for details of each type.\n\n\nUsing a catalog file\n\n\nThere are four ways to load a catalog file into a TerriaJS application:\n\n\n\n\nStore it in Terria Map's \nwwwroot/init\n directory, and refer to it in the \ninitializationUrls\n section of the \nconfig.json\n file. It is loaded automatically when you visit the webpage.  This is how \nwwwroot/init/terria.json\n is loaded in the default TerriaMap setup.\n\n\nStore it in Terria Maps's \nwwwroot/init\n directory, without adding it to config.json. Add the catalog file name (without \n.json\n) to the URL after \n#\n. For instance, \nexample.com/terria#mycatalog\n. See \nControlling with URL Parameters\n for more information. This method is useful when developing a catalog that is not quite ready for public access, but it is helpful to show it to interested stakeholders.\n\n\nStore it anywhere on the web (on a \nCORS-enabled\n server). Add the complete URL (including \n.json\n) to the URL, after \n#\n. For instance, \nhttp://nationalmap.gov.au/#http://example.com/mycatalog.json\n. This method is useful when developing services for a TerriaJS instance which you don't directly control, and for rapidly previewing changes which you can also share with people.\n\n\nStore it locally, then drag and drop it into the Terria Map window.\n\n\n\n\nAll catalog files, however loaded, are merged together in TerriaJS. Any two items with the same name and place in the tree are combined. This means that if two catalog files each define a group called \"Water\", there will be only one \"Water\" group in Terria, containing the two sets of group members merged together.\n\n\nEditing catalog files\n\n\nCatalog files can be edited three ways:\n\n\n\n\nUsing a desktop text editor. Be very careful to ensure that your file is valid JSON. This is more restrictive format than simple JavaScript, for instance. You can use \nhttp://jsonlint.com/\n.\n\n\nUsing a JSON-specific editor, such as \nhttp://www.jsoneditoronline.org/\n. This has the advantage that your file will be valid JSON.\n\n\nUsing the TerriaJS Catalog Editor, currently available in a preview version at \nhttp://terria.io/DataSourceEditor/\n. This editor is not yet considered reliable, and may cause data corruption.\n\n\n\n\nCatalog file properties\n\n\ncorsDomains\n\n\nBy default, TerriaJS proxies all requests within the proxy whitelist specified in the \nServer-side Config\n, making the assumption that the servers do not support CORS. You can add hosts that are known to support CORS to this property to avoid proxying them.\n\n\n\"corsDomains\": [ \"myserver.gov.au\" ]\n\n\nSee \nCross-Origin Resource Sharing\n for more information.\n\n\nhomeCamera\n and \ninitialCamera\n\n\nMaps have two camera positions, \nhomeCamera\n and \ninitialCamera\n. They are specified identically. All the examples here use \nhomeCamera\n, but apply equally to both.\n\n\n\n\ninitialCamera\n: the location when the map first displays\n\n\nhomeCamera\n: where the camera goes when you click the \"home\" button between the zoom-in and zoom-out buttons.\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: \nnorth\n, \nsouth\n, \neast\n, \nwest\n\n\nThe bounding box method uses \nnorth\n, \neast\n,\nsouth\n, and \nwest\n, in lat/lng decimal degrees.

It is loaded automatically when you visit the webpage.  This is how  wwwroot/init/terria.json  is loaded in the default TerriaMap setup.  Store it in Terria Maps's  wwwroot/init  directory, without adding it to config.json. Add the catalog file name (without  .json ) to the URL after  # . For instance,  example.com/terria#mycatalog . See  Controlling with URL Parameters  for more information. This method is useful when developing a catalog that is not quite ready for public access, but it is helpful to show it to interested stakeholders.  Store it anywhere on the web (on a  CORS-enabled  server). Add the complete URL (including  .json ) to the URL, after  # . For instance,  http://nationalmap.gov.au/#http://example.com/mycatalog.json . This method is useful when developing services for a TerriaJS instance which you don't directly control, and for rapidly previewing changes which you can also share with people.  Store it locally, then drag and drop it into the Terria Map window.   All catalog files, however loaded, are merged together in TerriaJS. Any two items with the same name and place in the tree are combined.

Web browsers impose restrictions on how we're allowed to access data across hosts (e.g. accessing data on \ndata.gov.au\n from a web site running at \nnationalmap.gov.au\n).  Understanding these issues will avoid a lot of frustration while trying to add your data to a TerriaJS application.\n\n\nTerriaJS can interface with three broad types if data:\n\n\n\n\nCatalog Group\n: A group (folder) of items.  Different group types allow the contents to be manually specified or to be automatically determined by querying various types of server.  TerriaJS can use many different types of servers to populate a group, including CKAN, CSW, WMS, and more.  For example, if you define a catalog group that points at a Web Map Service (WMS) server, TerriaJS will query the WMS \nGetCapabilities\n when the group is opened and fill the group with all of the layers advertised by the WMS server.\n\n\nCatalog Item\n: Actual geospatial or chart data from a file or service, in various formats.  TerriaJS supports WMS, KML, GeoJSON, ArcGIS MapServer, and many more files and services as catalog items.\n\n\nCatalog Function\n: A parameterized service, such as a Web Processing Service (WPS).  The user supplies the parameters and gets back some result.",

            "location": "/connecting-to-data/cross-origin-resource-sharing/", 
            "text": "To ensure that TerriaJS is able to access your data, you must add all servers you intend to access to \ndevserverconfig.json\n's \nallowProxyFor\n list. This \"whitelist\" authorizes the proxy to work with those servers.\n\n\nFailing to do this may result in an error like this:\n\n\n...the server does not support CORS. If this is your server, verify that CORS is enabled and enable it if it is not. If you do not control the server, please contact the administrator of the server and ask them to enable CORS. Or ... ask us to add this server to the list of non-CORS-supporting servers that may be proxied.\n\n\nNext, you should add servers that \ndo\n support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to the \ncorsDomains\n list in your \ninitialization file\n. Servers in this list are contacted directly instead of going through the proxy... except:\n\n\n\n\nin Internet Explorer 9\n\n\nif an HTTPS web page is accessing an HTTP server (this way we avoid a mixed content warning from the browser).\n\n\n\n\nIf your server does \nnot\n support CORS, then you still need to add it to the \nallowProxyFor\n whitelist, but do not add it to the \ncorsDomains\n list. It will then be proxied.\n\n\nSometimes we deliberately exclude CORS-supporting servers from the \ncorsDomains\n list; the proxy caches its data, so we leverage its caching to improve performance.\n\n\nIn both lists, a server name \nfoo.org\n will be interpreted as \n*.foo.org\n. The port must match exactly. It's not very smart, so if you specify port 80 that won't match a server without a port specified, and vice-versa.\n\n\nThe downside to a permissive whitelist is that you'll proxy for more servers, and people could use your proxy to make their (malicious?) traffic look like it's coming from your server instead of from theirs.\n\n\nMore Detailed Explanation\n\n\nAs a general rule, web browsers do not allow web sites running on one host (e.g. \nnationalmap.gov.au\n) from accessing data running on another host (e.g. \ndata.gov.au\n) unless the data server (\ndata.gov.au\n in our example) explicitly enables a feature called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) by including a special HTTP header in its response.  Unfortunately, many servers still do not support CORS.  If you control the server you're trying to access data on, enabling CORS is almost certainly a good idea, and you can read more about how to do it at \nenable-cors.org\n.\n\n\nTerriaJS has a trick to allow it to access data from a server even if that server doesn't support CORS: it uses a proxy server built into \nterriajs-server\n, which is included with TerriaMap.  The idea is simple: we avoid the need for cross-origin support from servers by running a proxy on the same host that runs our app.  That proxy can make requests to \nother\n servers on our application's behalf.  This works because cross-origin restrictions are a security feature of web browsers, not web servers.  The proxy makes it look to the browser like the data comes from the same origin.  There's nothing dodgy about this.  The risks that browsers are defending against by imposing cross-origin restrictions are not present in this scenario.\n\n\nHowever, by running a proxy server, our TerriaMap server potentially opens itself up to risks.  We don't want people to be able to bounce arbitrary requests through our proxy, because that could be used to make (malicious?) traffic look like it is coming from your server instead of from the real source.  This is why \nterriajs-server\n uses a whitelist of servers that it is willing to proxy for.  The \nallowProxyFor\n property in \ndevserverconfig.json\n specifies the whitelist.

In fact the json\nis exactly the same as the initialization file, and can be included there too.\n\n\nLet's start with an example.

You will see a new item called\n\"Victorian postcodes\". Add this to the map.\n\n\nTwo things will happen. First, you will get a message telling you that many of the values\nare not actually valid Australian postcodes. We'll fix that in a moment. Second, you will\nsee a swathe of yellow-green color across Victoria.

If your data can be made accessible publicly, \ngithub gists\n are a convenient way to do this.\n\n\nFor small data files, you can embed the data directly in the json too, eg. instead of \n\"url\"\n, use:\n\n\n            \ndata\n: \nlon,lat,value\\n134.384,-26.716,5\\n121.659,-33.592,10\n\n\n\n\n\nManipulating time\n\n\ntimeColumn\n\n\nYou can set which column controls the time slider by setting \ntimeColumn\n:\n\n\n            \ntableStyle\n: {\n                \ntimeColumn\n: \nname-or-index-of-column\n\n            }\n\n\n\n\nUse \n\"timeColumn\": null\n to remove the time slider altogether for this dataset.\n\n\nidColumns\n\n\nIf you have data that shows particular features over time, you can have a time-series plot of the\nchosen column values to appear in the feature info panel when you click on a feature, so long\nas you tell TerriaJS how to track individual features over time.\n\n\nIf your table has a time column and a column named \nid\n, this will happen automatically.\n\n\nOtherwise, you can tell TerriaJS which column or columns to use for the feature ids, by setting\n\nidColumns\n (this is on at the same level as the dataset's name or type, not inside \ntableStyle\n).\nThis should be an array of column names or indexes, eg.\n\n\n        \nidColumns\n: [\nfeature name\n],\n\n\n\n\nIf your features have fixed lat/lon positions, you could use:\n\n\n        \nidColumns\n: [\nlat\n, \nlon\n],\n\n\n\n\nControlling how table columns appear in the workbench\n\n\ndataVariable\n\n\nIf you want the dataset to start with a different column selected, use \ndataVariable\n:\n\n\n            \ntableStyle\n: {\n                \ndataVariable\n: \nname-or-index-of-column\n\n            }\n\n\n\n\ncolumns\n\n\nIf you want to change the appearance of individual columns, use \ntableStyle\n's \ncolumns\n property, eg:\n\n\n          \ntableStyle\n: {\n            \ncolumns\n: {\n              \noriginal name\n: {\n                \nname\n: \nbetter name\n,\n                \nformat\n: {\n                  \nmaximumFractionDigits\n: 0\n                }\n              },\n              \nbad\n: {\n                  \ntype\n: \nhidden\n\n              }\n            }\n          },\n\n\n\n\nThis example shows a few possibilities:\n\n\n\n\nA column called \"original name\" is displayed with the name \"better name\".\n\n\nThe legend for that column is shown without any decimal places (\nmaximumFractionDigits\n 0).\n\n\nA column in the original data called \"bad\" is hidden from the workbench.\n\n\n\n\nThe full list of options is in \nTableColumnStyle\n.\n\n\nColoring\n\n\nUse the following settings to adjust how points and regions are colored.\n\n\ncolorMap\n\n\nIn the example above we specified the two ends of the color spectrum to use via the setting\n\n\"colorMap\": \"green-orange\"\n, where \ngreen\n and \norange\n are two colors in CSS format. In fact you can specify as many colors as you like, separated by hyphens, and the colors are evenly spaced over the range of values, eg.\n\n\n                \ncolorMap\n: \nred-white-hsl(240,50%,50%)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want more control what fraction of the range each color should apply,\nyou can use this alternative syntax:\n\n\n                \ncolorMap\n: [\n                    {\n                        \ncolor\n: \nrgba(0,0,200,1.0)\n,\n                        \noffset\n: 0\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \ncolor\n: \nrgba(200,200,200,1.00)\n,\n                        \noffset\n: 0.6\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \ncolor\n: \nrgba(200,0,0,1.00)\n,\n                        \noffset\n: 1\n                    }\n                ],\n\n\n\n\ncolorBins\n\n\nYou can explicitly state how many colors (color \"bins\") you want to divide the data into, eg.\n\n\n                \ncolorBins\n: 16\n\n\n\n\nor, if you have specific boundaries in mind, you can list them, eg.\n\n\n                \ncolorBins\n: [3000, 3100, 3800, 3850, 3950, 4000]\n\n\n\n\ncolorPalette\n\n\nTo simplify the settings, you can specify a \nColorBrewer\n\npalette directly, eg.\n\n\n            \ntableStyle\n: {\n                \ncolorPalette\n: \n10-class Set3\n,\n                \ncolorBins\n: 10\n            }\n\n\n\n\n\"10-class BrBG\"\n is also a valid choice.\n\n\nThis property is ignored if colorMap is defined.\n\n\ncolorBinMethod\n\n\nUse this to force a particular method for quantizing colors.\nThe alternatives are \"auto\" (the default), \"ckmeans\", \"quantile\" or \"none\"\n(equivalent to \n\"colorBins\": 0\n).\n\n\nimageUrl\n\n\nFor lat/lon datasets, if you want to use a particular image instead of a circle,\nyou can specify its url as the \nimageUrl\n, eg. in \ntest.json\n:\n\n\n            \nimageUrl\n: \ntest/images/pow32.png\n,\n\n\n\n\nSizing\n\n\nscale\n\n\nThe size of each point (or image), eg.\n\n\n            \ntableStyle\n: {\n                \nscale\n: 2\n            }\n\n\n\n\nscaleByValue\n\n\nA Boolean for whether points should be scaled by the value of the variable (default false).\n\n\n            \ntableStyle\n: {\n                \nscale\n: 2,\n                \nscaleByValue\n: true\n            }\n\n\n\n\nminDisplayValue\n\n\nAll data values less than or equal to this are considered equal for the purpose of display.\n\n\nmaxDisplayValue\n\n\nAll data values greater than or equal to this are considered equal for the purpose of display.\n\n\nclampDisplayValue\n\n\nA Boolean - if true, display values that fall outside the display range show as min and max colors.\n\n\nOther settings\n\n\nFor a full list of the available settings, see the \nTableStyle\n and \nTableColumnStyle\n models mentioned earlier.\n\n\nMore examples\n\n\nSome examples are here:\n\nhttps://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/blob/master/wwwroot/test/init/test-tablestyle.json\n\n\nYou can add this directly to your catalog by appending \n#build/TerriaJS/test/init/test-tablestyle.json\n to the URL to your map, eg. \nhttp://localhost:3001/#build/TerriaJS/test/init/test-tablestyle.json\n.",

Eg. {\"SUBJECT\": [\"GDP\", \"GNP\"], \"FREQUENCY\": [\"A\"]}.\nIf not defined, all values are allowed.\nIf a dimension is not present, all values for that dimension are allowed.\nNote this will not be applied to regions or time periods.\nThe expression is first matched as a regular expression (sandwiched between ^ and  );\nif that fails, it is matched as a literal string.  So eg. \"[0-9]+\" will match 015 but not A015.  zoomOnEnable  A value indicating whether the map will automatically zoom to this catalog item when it is enabled.  Note that within a single init source:   Catalog items with both  isEnabled  and  zoomOnEnable  set to true will override the top-level  initialCamera  property.  If multiple catalog items have both  isEnabled  and  zoomOnEnable  set to true, it is undefined which one will affect the camera.   In the case of multiple init sources, however, the camera will reflect whatever happens in the  last  init source, whether\nit is a result of a  zoomOnEnable  or an  initialCamera ,",

The value of the property is an array\nof dimensions available for this layer.  A dimension has the fields shown in the example below.  See the\nWMS 1.3.0 specification, section C.2, for a description of the fields.  All fields are optional except\n\nname\n and \noptions\n.\n\n\navailableStyles\n\n\nThe available styles for each selected layer in WebMapServiceCatalogItem's layers.

You'll need Node.js 4.0+ installed on the server in order to run terriajs-server.  \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNode.js 5.0+ is required to \nbuild\n TerriaMap, but only 4.0+ is required to \nrun\n it.\n\n\n\n\nThen, copy the following files and directories from your local system where you built TerriaMap onto the server:\n\n\n\n\nwwwroot\n\n\nnode_modules\n\n\ndevserverconfig.json\n\n\n\n\nAnd on the server, change to the directory where you copied those files and directories and run:\n\n\n./node_modules/terriajs-server/run_server.sh --config-file devserverconfig.json\n\n\n\n\nThe server will start on port 3001.  You can specify a different port by adding \n--port 1234\n to the command-line above.\n\n\nIt is usually a good idea to run another web server, such as \nnginx\n or \nVarnish\n on port 80 and then reverse-proxy to the Node.js server, rather than running terriajs-server on port 80 directly.   You will find configuration files for Varnish with the TerriaMap source code in the \nvarnish directory\n.  In addition to acting as a reverse proxy for the Node.js server, the supplied Varnish configuration also caches requests to proxied map data in order to improve performance.\n\n\nUsing any web server\n\n\nterriajs-server\n, described above, only does a few things:\n\n\n\n\nIt serves up the static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that make up the application.\n\n\nIt includes a simple service at \n/proxy\n that allows TerriaJS to access geospatial data servers that don't support \nCORS\n.  If this service is not available, TerriaJS won't be able to access any datasets that are on other servers and that don't support CORS.\n\n\nIt includes another service at \n/convert\n that uses \nGDAL\n and OGR to transform otherwise unsupported geospatial vector data (e.g. shapefiles) to GeoJSON for display by the TerriaJS client.  If this service is not available, these data formats will not be supported.  However, all the \nformats that TerriaJS supports directly\n will work just fine.\n\n\nWhen configured correctly, it persists blobs of JSON for use in the sharing feature.  If this service is not available, the JSON can be stored in the share URL, instead.  However, this makes for some extremely long URLs.\n\n\n\n\nIf these limitations are acceptable, you can run your TerriaMap on virtually any web server by simply copying the TerriaMap \nwwwroot\n onto the server!\n\n\nYou can also incrementally add these services to your own server, as necessary, by porting the code in \nterriajs-server\n to your environment.",

There are currently no hosted builds of these images. To build and deploy these docker images locally:\n\n\nnpm install\ngulp release\n\n# Build the application server image.\nsudo docker build -t nationalmap/backend .\n\n# Build the varnish image.\nsudo docker build -t nationalmap/varnish varnish/\n\n# Start the backend image you built.\nsudo docker run -d -p 3001 --name nationalmap nationalmap/backend\n\n# Start the varnish image you built.\nsudo docker run -d -p 80:80 --name varnish --link nationalmap:nm nationalmap/varnish\n\n\n\n\nThis exposes varnish on port 80. Port 3001 for nationalmap remains behind docker's NAT. If you wish to interact with it directly change\n\n\n-p \ninternal port\n\n\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n-p \nexternal port\n:\ninternal port\n\n\n\n\n\nfor this component.\n\n\nThere is also a docker_release.sh bash script available that will carry out these commands and post to an AWS instance.  If you are not deploying on AWS you can use the script as a starting point for creating your own script.\n\n\n    Syntax: deploy_release pem_file host_name_or_ip\n    example: deploy_release login.pem 54.79.62.244\n\n\n\n\nSome handy commands:\n\n\n# If you want to avoid using sudo on every docker command (log out and log in after)\nsudo groupadd docker\nsudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker\n\n# If you want to open a shell into the running docker container, you can use this command:\nsudo docker run -ti nationalmap/backend /bin/bash\n\n# To remove all containers\nsudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)\n\n# To remove all images\nsudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -a -q)\n\n# To save created images to a tar file\nsudo docker save nationalmap/backend \n nm_backend.tar\nsudo docker save nationalmap/varnish \n nm_varnish.tar\n\n# And to load them back in\nsudo docker load \n nm_backend.tar\nsudo docker load \n nm_varnish.tar\n\n\n\n\nIf you're deploying varnish to an environment with less than 25GB on the root file system, or for whatever reason you want to specify the location of the cache file e.g. using an EBS volume, you can set the path for that:\n\n\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 --name varnish -v \ncache-dir\n:/mnt/cache/varnish --link nationalmap:nm nationalmap/varnish\n\n\n\n\nThe current release with ubuntu 14.04 is rather old and is missing some useful commands.  To update to the most recent of release of Docker, use the commands below from \nhere\n.\n\n\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E9\nsudo sh -c \necho deb https://get.docker.io/ubuntu docker main \n /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lxc-docker",

For example to create a geoserver called my_new_geoserver use the commands below.\n\n\nsudo cp geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/my_new_geoserver.war\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 restart\n\n\n\n\nYou should now be able to see a geoserver running at http://localhost:8080/my_new_geoserver/ .  \n\n\nThe geoserver will contain the example datasets that ship with Geoserver.  Geoserver has good documentation available \nhere\n to get you going on entering your data into your server instance.\n\n\nCaching Tiles\n\n\nIn order for your server to perform effectively we highly recommend that you cache the tile requests from National Map.  There are 2 primary ways to do this - either turning on the GeoWebCache that comes with Geoserver or running a proxy server in front of your geoserver.\n\n\nThe easiest solution is to just use the GeoWebCache service.  The documentation for GeoWebCache is \nhere\n.  Mainly it consists of turning on direct integration in the caching defaults and making sure that your layers have caching turned on.  You may also want to control the caching folder which can be done by editing your geoserver instance as explained \nhere\n.  You will also probably need to set permissions in your new cache folder to 666.\n\n\nThe other solution is to put a caching proxy in front of your geoserver instance.  This also has the benefit of being able to access your server on port 80 if you wish.  The two primary options we have worked with are \nnginx\n and \nvarnish\n.  These are both available as packages on ubuntu.  Below is an example of setting up nginx to work with geoserver.\n\n\nnginx\n\n\nsudo apt-get install -y nginx\n\n\n\n\nThen modify the configuration files to point to your server and turn on caching\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop\nsudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.orig\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\n\n\n\nand add this line at the bottom of the http section\n\n\nproxy_cache_path /your/cache/folder/ keys_zone=one:10m max_size=8G;\n\n\n\n\nsudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.orig\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default\n\n\n\n\nin the servers section, comment out the root and index lines and add this line right after\n\n\nproxy_cache one;\n\n\n\n\nand replace the location setting in the server section with the following code (replacing my_new_geoserver with your server name)\n\n\n    location /my_new_geoserver/ {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;\n        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;\n            proxy_redirect off;\n            proxy_buffering off;\n            proxy_set_header        Host            $http_host;\n            proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;\n            proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n    }\n\n\n\n\nNow restart\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx start\n\n\n\n\nAnd if all went as planned you should be able to access your server at http://localhost/my_new_geoserver/web.\n\n\nAllowing National Map to access your server\n\n\nDue to security in modern browsers, for National Map to use your service you will probably need to do a little more work.  Either you will need to set up your server with CORS support or provide a proxy service for your geoserver to allow National Map access to your data.  National Map includes a proxy to some domains by default and if you are in these domains we will provide the proxy service.\n\n\nIf you are not in these domains, you will get an cross-domain-access error. To work with National Map without using a proxy, Geoserver must be configured to support \nCORS\n.  The most common way to do this is to install \nCORS Filter\n.\n\n\nAn alternative approach, is to add CORS support to your nginx or varnish proxy service.  See the documentation on how to do this.  Thanks to the AREMI team, adding the necessary CORS headers with a Varnish reverse-proxy in front of the Geoserver can be done by adding the following to \n/etc/varnish/default.vcl\n:\n\n\nsub vcl_fetch {\n    set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Origin = \n*\n;\n    set beresp.http.Access-Control-Allow-Credentials = \ntrue\n;\n}\n\n\n\n\nMoving your Geoserver Instance\n\n\nMoving your geoserver instance to a new location is pretty straightforward.  The .war file that a geoserver instance comes in is just a special layout of a .zip file.  So the following commands can be used to create a .war file that you can then add to a tomcat instance on another server.\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 stop\nsudo mv /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/my_new_geoserver .\ncd my_new_geoserver\nzip -r my_new_geoserver.war *\nsudo mv my_new_geoserver /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 start\n\n\n\n\nonce it's uploaded to the new site you can add the geoserver with:\n\n\nsudo cp my_new_geoserver.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/my_new_geoserver.war\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 restart\n\n\n\n\nRunning your Geoserver on AWS\n\n\nRunning a geoserver on a standard EC2 instance requires a little tuning to take advantage of the instance storage volume properly.  First go ahead and create your instance (we use a standard m3.large instance with port 80 opened) and install java and tomcat as explained above.\n\n\nNow package up your geoserver as described in the previous section and copy it up to your EC2 instance and ssh in once it's copied.\n\n\nscp -i geoserver-instance.pem my_new_geoserver.war ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx:/home/ubuntu\nssh -i geoserver-instance.pem ubuntu@xx.xx.xx.xx\n\n\n\n\nFrom the shell the first thing you need to do is move the webapps folder in tomcat to the instance storage.\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 stop\nsudo cp -rf /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps.orig\nsudo mv /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ /mnt\nsudo ln -s /mnt/webapps /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps\n\n\n\n\nand copy your uploaded geoserver\n\n\nsudo cp *.war /mnt/webapps\n\n\n\n\nand then restart\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat7 start\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using geowebcache or a caching proxy you will need to change the caching dir as referenced above to also be on the /mnt drive to avoid running out of space on the EC2 boot drive.\n\n\nNOTE: If the instance is stopped you will need to go through these step again when you start, since the instance storage is wiped clean in this case.  This does not apply to reboot of the OS in the EC2 instance so it will still be fine after.",

            "text": "First, read \nGetting Started\n.\n\n\nBuilding a TerriaMap against a modified TerriaJS\n\n\nWhat if you need to make changes to \nTerriaJS\n while working on a site that depends on it?\n\n\nIn the process described in \nGetting Started\n, the \nTerriaJS package\n is installed to the \nnode_modules\n directory by \nnpm install\n.  Please do not edit TerriaJS directly in the \nnode_modules\n directory, because changes will be clobbered the next time you run \nnpm install\n.\n\n\nInstead, we want to clone TerriaJS from its \nGitHub repo\n and use that in our TerriaMap build.  Traditionally, \nnpm link\n is the way to do this.  However, we do not recommend use of \nnpm link\n because it frequently leads to multiple copies of some libraries being installed, which in turn leads to all sorts of frustrating build problems.  Instead, we recommend \nnpmgitdev\n.  \nnpmgitdev\n lets us safely clone a git repo into our \nnode_modules\n directory and use it pretty much as if npm had put it there itself.\n\n\nFirst, install \nnpmgitdev\n globally:\n\n\nnpm install -g npmgitdev\n\n\n\n\nThen, in your TerriaMap directory, remove the existing \nterriajs\n package, and clone the terriajs repo there instead.\n\n\ncd node_modules\nrm -rf terriajs\ngit clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs.git\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\nThis will give you the \nmaster\n branch of TerriaJS.  While we strive to keep \nmaster\n stable and usable at all times, you must be aware that \nmaster\n is less tested than actual releases, and it may not be commpatible with the \nmaster\n branch of TerriaMap.  So, you may want to check out the actual version of TerriaJS that you're using before you start making changes.  To do that:\n\n\ngrep terriajs package.json\n# will print something like: \nterriajs\n: \n^4.5.0\n\ncd node_modules/terriajs\ngit checkout 4.5.0\ncd ../..\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you run \nnpm install\n, \nnpm\n will fail with an error like this:\n\n\nnpm ERR! git C:\\github\\TerriaMap\\node_modules\\terriajs: Appears to be a git repo or submodule.\nnpm ERR! git     C:\\github\\TerriaMap\\node_modules\\terriajs\nnpm ERR! git Refusing to remove it. Update manually,\nnpm ERR! git or move it out of the way first.\n\n\n\n\nThis is \ngood\n!  It means \nnpm\n recognizes that your \nterriajs\n directory is now a git repo, and it is refusing to touch it out of fear of making you lose your work.  This is where \nnpmgitdev\n comes in:\n\n\nnpmgitdev install\n\n\n\n\nnpmgitdev\n is a wrapper around \nnpm\n that, for each git repo in \nnode_modules\n:\n\n\n\n\nMakes sure your working directory is clean (i.e. you have no uncommitted changes).\n\n\nMoves the \n.git\n directory out of the way so that \nnpm\n can't see it or clobber it.\n\n\nCopies all the \ndevDependencies\n in \npackage.json\n into \ndependencies\n.  This way npm will install all your dev-time stuff too.\n\n\nRuns \nnpm\n normally.\n\n\nMoves the \n.git\n directory back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you hit CTRL-C while \nnpmgitdev\n is running, it will be unable to clean up after itself automatically.  Look for a \nnpmgitdev-XXXXX\n directory.  The \nmappings.json\n file in that directory contains a record of the changes that \nnpmgitdev\n made so that you can undo them manually.  Usually this just means moving the \n.git\n directory back.\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can edit TerriaJS in \nnode_modules/terriajs\n with the benefit of a full-feature git repo.\n\n\nTo switch TerriaMap back to using the npm version of TerriaJS (instead of the git repo), do:\n\n\n# warning: make sure you don't need any of your changes to TerriaJS first!\nrm -rf node_modules/terriajs\nnpmgitdev install\n\n\n\n\nCommitting modifications\n\n\nIf you make changes to TerriaJS and TerriaMap together, here's the process for getting them to production.\n\n\nFirst, commit your TerriaJS changes to a branch and open a pull request to merge that branch to master. Simultaneously, you may want to make a branch of TerriaMap that uses your modified version of TerriaJS.  To do that, modify TerriaMap's \npackage.json\n.  Where it has a line like:\n\n\nterriajs\n: \n^4.5.0\n,\n\n\n\n\nChange it to:\n\n\nterriajs\n: \ngit://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs.git#branchName\n,\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nbranchName\n with the name of the TerriaJS branch you want to use.  You may even use a repository other than \nTerriaJS/terriajs\n if your branch is in a fork of TerriaJS instead of in the official repository.\n\n\nOnce your TerriaJS pull request has been merged and a new version of the \nterriajs\n npm module has been published, please remember to update \npackage.json\n to point to an official \nterriajs\n version instead of a branch in a GitHub repo.\n\n\nThe \npackage.json\n in the \nmaster\n branch of TerriaMap should point to official releases of \nterriajs\n on npm, NOT GitHub branches.\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nDocumentation is automatically generated from the source via JSDoc (reference) and MkDocs (user guide) by running:\n\n\nnpm run gulp docs\n\n\n\n\nIt will be placed in the \nwwwroot/doc\n folder.\n\n\nYou need a standalone install of MkDocs in order to build the user guide, see \nhttp://www.mkdocs.org/#installation\n for details.\n\n\nTests / Specs\n\n\nWe use \nJasmine\n for the TerriaJS tests, called specs in Jasmine parlance.  To run the specs, you first need to build them by running this in the TerriaJS  (not TerriaMap!) directory:\n\n\nnpm run gulp\n\n\n\n\nAnd start the development web server by running (also from the TerriaJS and not TerriaMap! directory):\n\n\nnpm start\n\n\n\n\nThe test suite is run by opening a web browser on \nhttp://localhost:3002/SpecRunner.html\n.

This task may take 10 seconds or more, which is the main reason for the next task.\n\n\nwatch\n - Starts the same as \nbuild\n but then it stays running and watches for changes to any TerriaJS or Cesium source file that was pulled in to the build. When a change to any of these files is detected, a fast incremental build is automatically kicked off.  The incremental build is much faster than the full rebuild because dependencies between source files are cached.\n\n\nrelease\n - The same as \nbuild\n except that it also minifies the build tests.\n\n\nlint\n - Runs ESLint on the files in the \nlib\n folder and reports any problems.  The ESLint rules are defined in the \n.eslintrc\n file in the root directory of TerriaJS.  A stricter set of rules is also find in the \n.eslintrc\n file in \nlib/ReactViews\n.\n\n\ndocs\n - Generates the user guide and reference documentation.  The user guide is served at \nhttp://localhost:3002/doc/guide/\n and the reference documentation is at \nhttp://localhost:3002/doc/reference/\n.\n\n\nmake-schema\n - Generates \nJSON Schema\n for the TerriaJS \nInitialization Files\n from the source code.  The schema is written to \nwwwroot/schema\n.\n\n\ntest\n - Detects browsers available on the local system and launches the test suite in each.  The results are reported on the command line.\n\n\ntest-electron\n - Runs the tests in Electron, a headless (no UI) Chrome-like browser.\n\n\ntest-saucelabs\n - Runs the tests on a bunch of browsers on \nSauce Labs\n.  You will need to \nSet up Sauce Labs\n.\n\n\ntest-browserstack\n - Runs the tests on a bunch of browsers on \nBrowserStack\n.  You will need to set up a BrowserStack account.\n\n\n\n\nSee \ngulpfile.js\n for more gulp tasks.\n\n\nTerriaMap Gulp Tasks\n\n\nRun any of these tasks with \nnpm run gulp \ntask name\n from within the TerriaMap directory:\n\n\n\n\ndefault - Invoked by running gulp without any arguments, this task invokes the \nbuild\n and \nlint\n tasks.\n\n\nbuild\n - Builds a non-minified version of TerriaMap, TerriaJS, Cesium, and all other dependencies, together in one JS file (called \nwwwroot/build/TerriaMap.js\n). Only the parts of TerriaJS and Cesium that we use (directly or indirectly) are pulled in.  Web Workers, CSS, and other resources are also built by this task.  This task may take 10 seconds or more, which is the main reason for the next task.\n\n\nwatch\n - Starts the same as \nbuild\n but then it stays running and watches for changes to any TerriaMap, TerriaJS, or Cesium resource. When a change to any of these files is detected, a fast incremental build is automatically kicked off.  The incremental build is much faster than the full rebuild because dependencies between source files are cached.\n\n\nrelease\n - The same as \nbuild\n except that it also minifies the built JavaScript files.  This task should be used when building for production.\n\n\nlint\n - Runs ESLint on \nindex.js\n and the files in the \nlib\n folder and reports any problems.  The ESLint rules are defined in the \n.eslintrc\n file in the root directory of TerriaMap.\n\n\nmake-package\n - Creates a \n.tar.gz\n package in \ndeploy/packages\n from the current build.  This package can be copied to another machine to run the application there.  The arguments are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--packageName \nname\n\n\nThe name of the package.

            "text": "What if you need to make changes to  TerriaJS  while working on a site that depends on it?  In the process described in  Getting Started , the  TerriaJS package  is installed to the  node_modules  directory by  npm install .  Please do not edit TerriaJS directly in the  node_modules  directory, because changes will be clobbered the next time you run  npm install .  Instead, we want to clone TerriaJS from its  GitHub repo  and use that in our TerriaMap build.  Traditionally,  npm link  is the way to do this.  However, we do not recommend use of  npm link  because it frequently leads to multiple copies of some libraries being installed, which in turn leads to all sorts of frustrating build problems.  Instead, we recommend  npmgitdev .   npmgitdev  lets us safely clone a git repo into our  node_modules  directory and use it pretty much as if npm had put it there itself.  First, install  npmgitdev  globally:  npm install -g npmgitdev  Then, in your TerriaMap directory, remove the existing  terriajs  package, and clone the terriajs repo there instead.  cd node_modules\nrm -rf terriajs\ngit clone https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs.git\ncd ..  This will give you the  master  branch of TerriaJS.  While we strive to keep  master  stable and usable at all times, you must be aware that  master  is less tested than actual releases, and it may not be commpatible with the  master  branch of TerriaMap.  So, you may want to check out the actual version of TerriaJS that you're using before you start making changes.  To do that:  grep terriajs package.json\n# will print something like:  terriajs :  ^4.5.0 \ncd node_modules/terriajs\ngit checkout 4.5.0\ncd ../..  Now, if you run  npm install ,  npm  will fail with an error like this:  npm ERR! git C:\\github\\TerriaMap\\node_modules\\terriajs: Appears to be a git repo or submodule.\nnpm ERR! git     C:\\github\\TerriaMap\\node_modules\\terriajs\nnpm ERR! git Refusing to remove it. Update manually,\nnpm ERR! git or move it out of the way first.  This is  good !  It means  npm  recognizes that your  terriajs  directory is now a git repo, and it is refusing to touch it out of fear of making you lose your work.  This is where  npmgitdev  comes in:  npmgitdev install  npmgitdev  is a wrapper around  npm  that, for each git repo in  node_modules :   Makes sure your working directory is clean (i.e. you have no uncommitted changes).  Moves the  .git  directory out of the way so that  npm  can't see it or clobber it.  Copies all the  devDependencies  in  package.json  into  dependencies .  This way npm will install all your dev-time stuff too.  Runs  npm  normally.  Moves the  .git  directory back.    Note  If you hit CTRL-C while  npmgitdev  is running, it will be unable to clean up after itself automatically.  Look for a  npmgitdev-XXXXX  directory.  The  mappings.json  file in that directory contains a record of the changes that  npmgitdev  made so that you can undo them manually.  Usually this just means moving the  .git  directory back.   Now, we can edit TerriaJS in  node_modules/terriajs  with the benefit of a full-feature git repo.  To switch TerriaMap back to using the npm version of TerriaJS (instead of the git repo), do:  # warning: make sure you don't need any of your changes to TerriaJS first!\nrm -rf node_modules/terriajs\nnpmgitdev install",
